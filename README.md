I'm Mr. Umesh Shelar. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and have over 3.5 years of experience in data analysis and reporting. Throughout my career, I've specialized in Power Quality analysis projects within the electrical domain, successfully completing over 50+ projects in this area.

I possess advanced skills in various tools and technologies such as Excel, Power BI, Python (including libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), as well as MySQL. These skills have been instrumental in delivering impactful insights and solutions across a wide range of projects.

Speaking of projects, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse real-world challenges, including predicting house prices, analyzing electrical power factor, conducting superstore analysis, exploring trends in the tile industry, and assessing student performance. Recently, I successfully completed the Atliq hardware project with the codebasics platform.

In approaching my projects, I adhere to the CRISP-DM methodology, ensuring a structured and effective workflow from understanding the problem statement, collecting and understanding the relevant data, to cleaning, preprocessing, encoding features, and ultimately employing machine learning techniques for prediction.

Overall, my blend of technical expertise, practical experience, and methodological approach makes me confident in my ability to tackle complex data challenges and deliver valuable insights."
